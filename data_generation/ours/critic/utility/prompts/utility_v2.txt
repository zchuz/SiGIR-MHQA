[3]: The reasoning process is mostly clear, partially logically structured, and supported by evidence, but may contains minor logical flaws.
[2]: The reasoning is somewhat unclear with noticeable flaws and uses limited or weak evidence.
[1]: The reasoning is flawed, lacking supporting evidence, which results in an incorrect conclusion.
