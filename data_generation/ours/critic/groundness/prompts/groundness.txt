### Question: What is the city where WXPN is located?

### Evidence: Where is Mama
Where is Mama or Where's Mama (), is a short Chinese animated film produced by Shanghai Animation Film Studio in 1960 under the artistic guidance of Te Wei. The narrated film describes the adventures and misadventures of a group of tadpoles in search of their mother. It is one of Te Wei's first attempts to break away from Western style animation and aim for a painterly style influenced by Qi Baishi and more in keeping with native Chinese aesthetic sensibilities. Because of its simple story line and repetitive script it is ideal for children who are beginning their study of the Chinese language.

### Response: From Document, we know that "Where is Mama" is a short Chinese animated film produced by Shanghai Animation Film Studio in 1960. Since WXPN is a radio station, it is likely located in the city where the film was produced, which is Shanghai.

Rating: [Not supported]
